# Fix for warnings after running wget at the Terminal on Apple machines purchased outside the United States. The warnings slow down script execution and ocassionaly result in failed, empty downloads.

# This is a known issue for non-US Apple machines using a US locale.

# Run from the Terminal:

echo "export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8" >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile

cat ~/.bash_profile

# Alternatively:

nano ~/.bash_profile

# Then paste into the editor

export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

# Then Cntrl-X, then Y, then Enter.
